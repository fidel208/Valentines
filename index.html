              Hello babe 💜. How are you. I know it's late past that time, but I
              tried all that i could to make this for you. From the moment we
              met, you've shown me how true love works. It has been
              approximately 3 months since we met and for real, I can't regret
              meeting you. Even though we are not seeing each other everyday, I
              can't complain. I know we are meeting soon and i can't wait to see
              you, talk to you and do many other stuffs with you. Everyday I
              always think of you and as I promised, you are mine forever, and
              I'm yours forever. Everyday I look at your pictures and I say to
              myslef, damn! I'm blessed to have you in my life. Remember to
              study smart and anytime you'll feel stressed and worried, remember
              that Fidel loves you. I love really really love you and i will
              marry you.
